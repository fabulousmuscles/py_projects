py_projects
========

This repository contains my solutions to some of [Karan Goel's Projects] (https://github.com/karan/Projects), written in
python 2.7.x. This is a work in progress, and the projects will be completed in no particular order. 
Only the projects I've completed will be listed, and I will likely be doing all kinds of stuff (that may or may not
be in Karan's Projects.).


Numbers
---------

[**Find PI to the Nth Digit**] (https://github.com/fabulousmuscles/py_projects/blob/master/Numbers/pi.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.


Networking
---------

[**Port Scanner**] (https://github.com/fabulousmuscles/py_projects/blob/master/Networking/scan.py)- Enter an IP address and a port range where the program will then attempt to find open ports on the given computer by connecting to each of them. On any successful connections mark the port as open.
