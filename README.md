py_projects
========

This repository contains my solutions to some of [Karan Goel's Projects] (https://github.com/karan/Projects), written in python.
This is a work in progress, and the projects will be completed in no particular order. Only the projects I've completed will
be listed, and I will likely be doing all kinds of stuff.


Numbers
---------

[**Find PI to the Nth Digit**] (https://github.com/fabulousmuscles/py_projects/blob/master/Numbers/pi.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
